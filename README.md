# Prework Study Guide Webpage
A study guide for bootcamp course prework

## Description

It is in most cases that during studies, one stores all forms of documentation in all manner i.e. everywhere and it soon became apparent that a single resource or repository was required to reference all said documentation.

Building a webpage appeared to be the easiest source of reference as it is portable and accessible anywhere and able to share and collaborate with others if need be.

Key learnings are the communication between platforms Visual Studio and GitHub - it's not all that it's cracked up to be. Sometimes VS drops connectivity and files are not updated. My expereince was to lose one directory only to have another created so had to doublecheck where there were two .git files created. I deleted one and file history was restored; (this is all sarcasm, 'tongue in cheek' but it did happen).

## Usage

Each section gives you a summary of events, 'tips and tricks' as guidance including HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git; all topics covered through the prework course. For example, if you open up DevTools in your favourite browser, one can see the JavaScript running.

• For suggestions on what to study first, open DevTools in your favourite browser e.g. Chrome by pressing Comman+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows) and a console will open either below or to the side of your webpage in your browser.
• Here you will see a list of topics learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
